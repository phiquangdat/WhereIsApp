- **Contributing**: Fork the repo, create a branch, and submit a PR.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Fails**: Run `./gradlew app:installDebug --stacktrace` and check logs.

Remove the gradle in your machine and start again:

`rm -rf /Users/yourusername/.gradle/`

`./gradlew clean build`
- **Camera Issues**: Ensure permissions are granted and a camera-supported device is used.
